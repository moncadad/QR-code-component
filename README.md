## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor

### What I learned

The project within itself was relatively simple, I decided to challenge myself to use Sass. I've dabbled in it before but I wouldn't call myself an expert. I stll wouldn't, but I definetly developed a deeper understanding than before. Although I wouldn't consider it as something extemely hard I would say remembering the semantics was probably the hardest part of it to the point I visited the documentation page a few times.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to focus on Sass more intermediate topicss for example partials, modules, mixins, inheritance and operators. So far I've only used variables and nesting.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7itlR6qESM&list=RDLVrxnX1jdoI6c&index=7) - Kevin Powell on Youtube has become a big help when it comes to css. This video helped me figure out how to approach a project to write better DRY code.
